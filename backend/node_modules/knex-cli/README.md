# Knex CLI

*Not the official [Knex](https://github.com/tgriesser/knex) CLI!* This is a drop-in replacement for the CLI that runs with extra features such as support for ES2015 syntax in seed/migration files.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install -g knex-cli
# Run just as you would with the original knex
knex-cli -h
```

## Features

- ES2015 support
- More coming soon
